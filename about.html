        <h1>Know About Me</h1>
        <p class="aboutmee">I am Kartikey Raghav. I was born on 22 July 2006. My father's name is Mr. Abhayjeet Singh Raghav and my mother's name is Mrs. Jyoti Raghav. I first studied in Vivekanad Academy which is situated near my house till 1<sup>st</sup> class. Then I went to study in S.D. Adarsh Vidyalaya and I am studying till now there only. When I was 13 years old, I came to know about <a target="_blank" href="https://www.whitehatjr.com/">Whitehat junior</a> which is a platform that teaches students, who are less than 14 years of age, coding. I joined it immediately. When I joined it I was very excited to know about their coding ciricullum. I have had many classes with whitehat junior and I have learnt many things in coding. I have created many games with the help of whitehat junior's support. It is an awesome platform to learn coding. Everyone should join it.</p>
